# Hidden_COT
Offical implementation of Expediting and Elevating Large Language Model Reasoning via Hidden Chain-of-Thought Decoding

Understand all by checking Class LlamaForCotCausalLM in [COT_model_training/model/modeling_llama.py](https://github.com/TjoyLiu/Hidden_COT/blob/main/COT_model_training/model/modeling_llama.py). This is used for training auxiliary CoT Model

Understand whole frame by checking Class LlamaForLLMHcotCausalLM in [train_script/model/] (https://github.com/TjoyLiu/Hidden_COT/blob/main/train_script/model/modeling_llama.py), this is to train the final H_CoT model.
